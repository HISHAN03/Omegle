# Omegle Clone🎥
<br>

## Overview🚀
<br>
This is a omegle clone web app which where two individuals can connect through video calls.
This project is developed as an "Internship-project" for my second-year internship and also as a exploration of WebRTC technology, diving deep into its workings and implementation. The primary focus is on understanding the establishing of peer-to-peer connections using webrtc.



## peer-to-peer🔗
<br>

- In simple terms, "peer-to-peer" means a direct connection or interaction between equals, without a middleman.
- peer-to-peer often refers to computers or devices connecting directly to share information or resources without relying on a central server

- At first boath browsers need to use a central server to exchange different objects
- after the exchange happens.the browsers can communicate directly
- even if the server goes down the browsers will be still connected
 

## Technologies Used💻
<br>

**web-rtc**: Communication Protocol
 ### Frontend🌐
- **React**
- **socket.io-client** 
 ### Backend⚙️
- **nodejs** 
- **express**
- **CORS**
- **socket.io**

## Installation🚀

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:HISHAN03/Omegle.git
   cd Omegle

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```sh
   # Server
     cd server
     npm install
   # Client
     cd ../client
     npm install
   
3. **Run the app**
   ```sh
   open terminal, run the client:
   cd client
   npm run dev
4. **No need to run server**
   ```sh
    backend code is already deployed online using render
   
5. **Access the app**
   ```sh
     Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5173.
