## Overview

This project serves as a  exploration of WebRTC technology, diving deep into its workings and implementation. Also developed as a project of my second-year college internship, this application uses React for the frontend, bootstrapped with Vite, and Node.js for the backend. The primary focus is on understanding the establishing of peer-to-peer connections.

### Technologies Used

- **React**: for frontend
- **socket.io**: for signaling server 
- **web-rtc**: for peer-to-peer connection
- **nodejs**: backend
- **express**:backend server
